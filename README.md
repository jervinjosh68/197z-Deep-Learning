Object Detection for Drinks Dataset project in 197z

This project is referenced from https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/detection and https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/tutorials/blob/gh-pages/_downloads/torchvision_finetuning_instance_segmentation.ipynb#scrollTo=LDjuVFgexFfh

Start downloading packages and modules using the following code:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To train the model:
`python train.py`

To test the model:
`python test.py`

To try the real-time drinks detection using device webcam:
`python demo.py`

Dataset and weights are downloaded via the following links, respectively:
